= YuZJ Process Profiler, version 2

This project is a user-level general-purposed process profiler based on process filesystem (procfs). It mainly consists of 3 small subprojects:

. link:./libprocfs-java/[`libprocfs-java`], a Java-based `procfs` reader.
. link:./process-info-collector/[`process-info-collector`], a Java-based process profiler.
. link:./process-info-analyzer/[`process-info-analyzer`], a Python-based process analyzation framework for data collected in the collector.

== Requirements

If you would like to profile some process, you need JDK >= 17.

If you need to analyze others' profiling result, please refer to the link:./process-info-analyzer/requirements.txt[`requirements.txt`] or `conda_env.yaml` file at `process-info-analyzer`.
