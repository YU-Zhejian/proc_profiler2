= Design for `libprocfs-java`

== Introduction

The `libprocfs-java` is a Java library designed to provide low-level process and kernel information by parsing GNU/Linux Process Filesystem (`procfs`) and `sysfs`.

The library is low-level and no caching is provided inside this library.
For higher performance you may implement the caching system yourself.
