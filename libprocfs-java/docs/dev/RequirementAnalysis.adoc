= Requirement Analysis for `libprocfs-java`

The `libprocfs-java` is a Java library designed to provide low-level process and kernel information by patsing GNU/Linux Process Filesystem (`procfs`) and `sysfs`.

The library is low-level and no caching is provided inside this library. For higher performance you may implement the caching system yourself.

This library will contain documentations from following sources:

. Linux Kernel documentation on link:https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/sysfs.html[`sysfs`] and link:https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/proc.html[`procfs`].
. GNU/Linux manual pages link:https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/procfs.5.html[`procfs(5)`] and link:https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/sysfs.5.html[`sysfs(5)`].
. The Linux Documentation Program (TLDP) documenattion for link:https://tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/proc.html[`procfs`].

This library is inspired and would reference code from following sources:
